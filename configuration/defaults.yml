# Define devices pluged into the pi.
devices:
  - type: adafruit_motorhat # Type selects a device driver from ./devices
    name: motorhat # Name becomes the ID by which you or a plugin can reference this device later.
    address: 0x60 # Address is specific to the motor hat. If it is not stated here it will default to 0x60
    
# Define driving configuration.
driving:
  mode: fcfs_tank # First come first serve with tank steering.
  motors: # By default motors 1 and 2 are the left drive wheels, and 3 and 4 are the right drive wheels. 
    left: 
      - motorhat.M1 # motorhat (as defined above) will be queried for a so-called M1.

# Define plugins
plugins: 
  sounds: # The built-in sounds plugin allows you to play .wav files over the speakers when the bot receives commands
    LOUD: /home/pi/loud_noise.wav # Play loud_noise.wav when the bot recieves the command 'LOUD'
#  simplemove: #The built-in simplemove plugin allows you to make primitive movments upon receiving a command
#    OPEN: #Could be used for opining and closing a claw.
#      motor: motorhat.M3
#      action: forward
#      time: 1
#    CLOSE: 
#      motor: motorhat.M3
#      action: reverse
#      time: 1

# The simplemove plugin is commented out because motorhat.M3 is already used for driving. 
# If you have a two motor drive mechanism, you can remove motorhat.M3 from driving 
# and uncomment simplemove to use it.
